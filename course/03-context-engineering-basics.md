# Module 03: Context Engineering Basics

**Estimated time:** ~15 minutes  
**Outcome:** Internalize context engineering as the core lever, not model tweaking

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Explain the "dumb zone" concept
- Apply context engineering techniques: writing, selecting, compressing, isolating
- Write context-engineered prompts vs basic prompts

---

## Content

> **TODO:** Add content covering:
> - Dumb zone concept, writing/selecting/compressing/isolating context
> - A tiny exercise: write a bad prompt vs a context-engineered one for a mini agent

---

## Exercise

> **TODO:** Add hands-on exercise comparing bad vs good prompts

---

## Check Your Understanding

> **TODO:** Add 3–5 reflection questions or exercises

---
