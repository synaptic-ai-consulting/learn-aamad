# Module 04: Orchestration Patterns and HITL

**Estimated time:** ~15 minutes  
**Outcome:** See orchestration patterns and HITL as design tools, not afterthoughts

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Identify different orchestration patterns (sequential, concurrent, manager-worker)
- Design HITL gates for approval and escalation workflows
- Choose appropriate patterns for different use cases

---

## Content

> **TODO:** Add content covering:
> - Sequential vs concurrent vs manager-worker in 1–2 diagrams
> - Simple HITL gating examples: approve-before-deploy, escalate-on-low-confidence

---

## Check Your Understanding

> **TODO:** Add 3–5 reflection questions or exercises

---

## Next Steps
