## Who This Is For

**Target learner:** Mid/senior software engineer who senses "AI is changing my job" and wants a **systematic way** to work with agents, not just vibe-code prompts.

**Promise:** In 4–6 hours, go from random AI coding to a repeatable 3-phase method (Define–Build–Deliver) using [AAMAD](https://github.com/synaptic-ai-consulting/AAMAD), with one small but real multi-agent outcome shipped.

---

## What You Will Build

By the end of this course, you will:

- Understand the **Agentic Architect** role and how it differs from "just using AI tools"
- Master the **AAMAD framework** (Define–Build–Deliver) for building multi-agent applications
- Learn **context engineering** as the core lever for AI-assisted development
- Experience **orchestration patterns** and Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) design
- Complete a hands-on mini-project using the AAMAD framework end-to-end

---

## Course Overview

This course is organized into three main sections:

### Section 1: Why Agentic Architect
Learn the mindset shift from traditional development to agentic architecture. Understand the value migration to coordination and the three hats of an Agentic Architect (tech, experience, business).

### Section 2: AAMAD in 3 Phases
Deep dive into the AAMAD framework:
- **Define:** Market research, PRD creation, context setup
- **Build:** Multi-agent development crew execution
- **Deliver:** Deployment, monitoring, and operational concerns

### Section 3: Hands-On Mini-Project
Apply everything you've learned by building a small multi-agent application using the AAMAD framework, from definition to deployment.

## How to Take This Course

### Suggested Learning Path

**Session 1 (2–3 hours):**
- Modules 01–04: Mindset + AAMAD + Context Engineering + Orchestration/HITL
- Fill PRD for your chosen mini-project

**Session 2 (2–3 hours):**
- Modules 05–07: Run mini-project, see agents produce code/artifacts, simulate delivery
- Module 08: Reflect on gaps → apply to Tier 1/Tier 2
